## 🧠 Project Overview

Recommender systems help users discover relevant items from large catalogs. In this project, we build a system that **recommends movies** based on similarity of movie features or user preferences. Such systems are widely used in entertainment platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and YouTube for personalized content suggestions. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

Typical approaches include:

- **Content-based filtering** — compares movie metadata (genre, keywords, actors, etc.)
- **Collaborative filtering** — finds patterns in user ratings
- **Hybrid methods** — combines both to improve accuracy :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
